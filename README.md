How to survive the systemd hype (without using systemd, obviously)

## Lists of systemd-free Linux distributions
There are actually a lot of systemd-free linux distributions, and there's a good chance you can live on your desktop and server systems without it.

### Distrowatch
To search distrowatch for distributions without systemd, you can try:

http://distrowatch.com/search.php?ostype=All&category=All&origin=All&basedon=All&notbasedon=None&desktop=All&architecture=All&package=All&rolling=All&isosize=All&netinstall=All&language=All&defaultinit=Not+systemd&status=Active#simple

Please note that this also lists init-hybrids, e.g. Linux Mint, which is shown there as "Init: systemd,SysV".

### without-systemd.org
without-systemd.org has a Wiki that lists various options of sane systemd-free distributions:
